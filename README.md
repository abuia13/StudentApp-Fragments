# StudentApp-Fragments

•	In this assignment, you need to convert the app you have developed in assignment 2 to work with fragments, menus, and dialogs. You need to use nav-graph and extend the app to include the following functionality:


1.	Each page will be implemented as a fragment. There should be only one activity in your app .


2.	You need to add an “Add” button (‘+’) as a menu in the action bar instead of the add button at the bottom of the screen on the main page.


3.	In the details screen, you should place the edit button as a menu in the action bar.


4.	After every save operation, an alert dialog should be displayed that tells the user that the save operation was completed successfully.


5.	You should add the following fields to the student date:
1.	birth date
2.	birth time
These fields should be implemented with the date view as shown in class. Pressing this field will open a picker.
 
All input text fields should be implemented with the same design as the date field.
